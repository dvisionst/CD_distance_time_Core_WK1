# CD_distance_time_Core_WK1
Distance and Time Exercise(Core)
For this exercise, you will be given a Colab file to follow along with.  As you proceed through the file you will be given instructions and be asked to apply some new functions to NumPy arrays. 

When you open the link to a shared Colab file, the first thing you will need to do is open the file menu and click on "save a copy in Drive".  This will allow you to add code and make changes to YOUR file without changing the file for everyone else!
